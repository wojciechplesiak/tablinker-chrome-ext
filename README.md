# Urly Chrome Extension
A Google Chrome Extension used to easily open links with page indicators/ticket number in a new tab.

# Configuration
1. Install this Extension from [Chrome WebStore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tablinker/dciojklibcmcjpfchhelbeaognffhibi)
2. Configure it by adding base URL and a label
3. Type what needs to be replaced in base URL or added at the end and press Enter (or "Go")
4. New tab will be opened on that link

# Screenshots
![Options](screenshots/options.png)

You can define multiple base urls. In that way you will get multiple entry text fields on a popup and you will be able to open several tabs with different webpages. In this example two base urls are set. Both point to Stack Overflow page and show two ways of defining base links:

1. in first one your input would be appended at the end
2. in second one your input will replace placeholder ' **%** ' 

![Popup](screenshots/popup.png)

Entering text and pressing Enter or "Go" will open new tab. In this example 3 tabs will be opened. First input opens one tab, and second input will be split on space into two separate entries and will be displayed on two separate tabs.
