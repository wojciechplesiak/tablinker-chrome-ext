New tab will be opened on that link\r\n\r\n# Screenshots\r\n![Options](https://github.com/wojciechplesiak/tablinker-chrome-extension/blob/master/screenshots/options.jpg)\r\n\r\nYou can define multiple base urls. In that way you will get multiple entry text fields on a popup and you will be able to open several tabs with different webpages. In this example two base urls are set. Both point to Stack Overflow page and show two ways of defining base links:\r\n1. in first one your input would be appended at the end\r\n2. in second one your input will replace placeholder ' % ' \r\n\r\n![Popup](https://github.com/wojciechplesiak/tablinker-chrome-extension/blob/master/screenshots/popup.jpg)\r\n\r\nEntering text and pressing Enter or \"Go\" will open new tab. In this example 3 tabs will be opened. First input opens one tab, and second input will be split on space into two separate entries and will be displayed on two separate tabs.\r\n\r\n# Changelog\r\nPlease see the [Changelog](https://github.com/wojciechplesiak/tablinker-chrome-extension/wiki/Changelog) page to see what's recently changed.\r\n\r\n# License\r\n```\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2016 Wojciech Plesiak\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
